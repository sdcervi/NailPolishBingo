### Summary
This tracker web app is tailored to nail polish enthusiasts, to help you organize and catalog your entire collection by brand and color.

Your progress syncs with the cloud automatically, and you can access your collection from any device with internet access.

Try it out today at [NailPolish.Bingo](https://nailpolish.bingo/).

### Development
I originally developed this as a passion project for my own use, to keep track of my growing [Holo Taco](https://www.holotaco.com/) collection. A few other options exist, like the [official Holo Taco Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NzRWMdQngZg_xnehoUtjtvUnc4nIaSbqUBqmE7KwB8g/edit#gid=186001220) and the [All The Combos Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UpAq1COY4xKPDq8CPqeI2v4v49vPUZ78uVxePL33-5Q/edit#gid=1935088350), but I wanted one that is more user-friendly, works on my phone, and cloud-syncs across all platforms and devices without any headaches. Google Sheets is notoriously terrible on iOS, and I knew I could build a better user experience.

### Technologies
Nail Polish Bingo uses Bootstrap 5.x, JavaScript, and Firebase to provide a streamlined and easy-to-maintain web-based application. There's a little bit of jQuery but most of it is vanilla ES6 JavaScript.

I designed it to be used primarily on mobile devices, for a 375px-wide viewport and larger. Everything was then scaled up and rearranged for larger screens as needed.

### Features
Check back later! I'm still building the core functionality of this.

### Project status
Nail Polish Bingo is being actively maintained.  Bugs are logged and fixed as discovered.
